Douglas Crockford seif (pronounced "safe") project

most of web development is working "around" limitations of the document retrieval model the web is based around

insecurity: cross site scripting, xsrf, clickjacking, dependence on passwords

project is made up of:
1. seifnode: a module containing crypto services for node js. libraries collect entropy from OS, Microphone, Camera. available now
2. seif protocol: secure json over tcp
3. safe resource management: using hashes to securely deliver assets
4. Seif apps. HTML-Free, javascript-based application delivery system built in node and Qt. Also trust management. No passwords
5. Seif helper app. Tool for running seif apps in a browser.

transition plan: convince a browser maker to integrate, convince a high-profile site to require it, everyone will love it so much that it'll get adopted...
