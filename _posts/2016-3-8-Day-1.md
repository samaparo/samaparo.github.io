## Functional Reactive Javascript ##
compositional event systems, more fitting name for session
"reactive" is a catch all term
rx, reactive extensions, implementation of a proposed es spec
observables. stream of events over time

how does it work on the client side?
ui elements emit streams of values -> reduce them into a new streams -> affect UI output

oh hey, using const for immutability

const value$ = Rx.Observable.fromEvent($slider, 'input', callback to map event to value);
const float$ = value$.map((x) => parseFloat(x));
float$.subscribe((valueToOutput) => $label.text(valueToOutput));

two streams, valueA$ and valueB$

const combined$ = Rx.Observable.combineLatest(valueA$, valueB$, (a,b) => a+b);
combined$.subscribe((sum) => $label.text(sum));

benefit: just javascript. observables just solve one problem

.startWith(initial value for stream)

in node, streams can be used to model network calls, allowing access of data without loading it all into memory
observables will be used to model communication, but streams still needed to talk to servers over http

redux is more functional that flux, but a lot of this could be implemented manually using observables

shared mutable state has a lot of overhead. in the context of react, state and lifecycle events

follow up: look at ajax examples in this model
