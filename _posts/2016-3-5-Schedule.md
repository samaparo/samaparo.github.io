You know that feeling when you have to decide between [modeling logic circuits in Minecraft](http://conferences.oreilly.com/fluent/javascript-html-us/public/schedule/detail/46415) and [examining a forthcoming alternative to javascript promises](http://conferences.oreilly.com/fluent/javascript-html-us/public/schedule/detail/46600)? I think we've all been there. No, really. I have to make decisions like this every day when I visit Hacker News or hear friends talking about some hot new framework. There's just not enough time to explore and evaluate every new web-thing you hear about. This can be frustrating, or even paralysing, but it's good to know that there's so much energy and experimentation in our field.

After several tough calls like the one above (I went with observables), I think I've finally hammered out my Fluent session schedule. Here's Tuesday's:

* [Functional reactive JavaScript on the client and the server](http://conferences.oreilly.com/fluent/javascript-html-us/public/schedule/detail/46615)
* [Repeatable processes for building secure containers](http://conferences.oreilly.com/fluent/javascript-html-us/public/schedule/detail/46750)
* [Real-time drawing in the browser with HTML5 Canvas](http://conferences.oreilly.com/fluent/javascript-html-us/public/schedule/detail/46762)
* [Create scalable and secure mobile apps that work offline](http://conferences.oreilly.com/fluent/javascript-html-us/public/schedule/detail/46365)
