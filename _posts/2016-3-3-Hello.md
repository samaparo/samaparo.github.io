title: Fluent 2016

Hi all. Next week I'll be heading to San Francisco to attend the [2016 O'Reilly Fluent Conference](http://conferences.oreilly.com/fluent/javascript-html-us) (ðŸŽ‰), and I'm planning to document the experience here. I'll be going to something like thirty lectures, so I probably won't be writing a detailed think-piece on each one. I will, however, do my best to jot down my notes and impressions so I don't sound like an idiot when I get back.

> The conference? It was cool. Like...really cool! They mostly talked about internet things and I saw Douglas Crockford.

More to come soon!
